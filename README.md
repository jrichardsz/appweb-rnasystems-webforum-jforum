=================================

My own versionof JForum. jforum is a discussion board software - a forum - widely kown for half a decade already. It powers many big forums around the globe, including Eletronic Arts' gaming forums, JavaRanch (one of the biggest and oldest Java communites), GUJ (the biggest Java development community for portuguese speakers). It is an Open Source project, maintained by serious developers. Check out more at some of production forums running jforum. More details : http://jforum.net
